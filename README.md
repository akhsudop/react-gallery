# Gallery Image App

Welcome to the Gallery Image App! This is a web application built with React and Vite that allows you to search for images and view them in a modal in a larger size. The image data is fetched from the Pixabay API. The app displays 12 images per page, and if there are more images available, a "Load More" button is shown.

## Features

- Search for images: Use the search bar to find images based on your search word or phrase.
- Open image: Click on an image to open it in a modal window, where you can see a larger version of the image.
- Pagination: The app displays 12 images per page. If there are more images available, a "Load More" button is shown, allowing you to load and view additional images.
